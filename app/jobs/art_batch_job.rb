# then checks back every few seconds and collects each image as it lands,
# until all are in, the batch fails, or it times out (ApplicationJob#poll_comfy).
#
# When ComfyUI or the language model can't be reached at all (asleep,
# restarting, off the network), nothing is lost: the batch says it's
# waiting, and the job is tried again (ApplicationJob.waits_for_services).
# ComfyUI answering with an error (a missing model, a bad graph) still fails
# the batch, with its reason.
