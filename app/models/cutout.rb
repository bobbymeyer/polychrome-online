# Taking the background off a generated image (docs/HANDOFF.md §8), in
# ComfyUI itself: the workflow saves the picture as rendered, then puts it
# through a removal node and saves the cut-out (Comfy::Workflow). The node
# is ComfyUI-RMBG's BiRefNetRMBG, with BiRefNet_toonout by default: BiRefNet
# fine-tuned on anime characters (ToonOut), which the node fetches itself
# the first time (config/comfy.yml `background_removal`). ComfyUI without
# the node stops the batch, saying what to install.
#
# A removal model takes whatever looks like the background, and on art
# drawn on white that includes the white inside the subject: a shirt, a
# face, a sail. Two things keep the white:
#
# - The picture is rendered on a ground of its own colour (#on_ground: a
#   flat green by default, in place of the type's "white background"), so
#   white in the design is never the ground's colour.
#
# - The cut-out is mended (#keep_interior): a cleared pixel counts as
#   background only if its colour is the ground's and it reaches the edge
#   of the picture through ground-coloured pixels. Anything else the model
#   cleared was part of the subject, and is put back from the picture as
#   rendered. On a white ground (no ground set), a white patch closed in
#   by the subject is put back too, since it can't be told apart; the
#   cost is a gap that really is background but closed in (an arm on a
#   hip), filled.
