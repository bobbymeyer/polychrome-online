# frozen_string_literal: true

# Rewrites the subject layer of an image prompt with a language model
# (config/llm.yml), in the way the image model reads best: booru tags for
# the anime families, plain sentences for the rest (Comfy::Family
# #prompt_style). Only the subject is rewritten: the house style, the
# framing and the family's quality words stay as the author wrote them, and
# the model is told about them so it doesn't repeat or contradict them.
#
# Answers are remembered, so the same entry asked again gets the same words
# (and an image model that caches its text encodings can reuse them).
